# Apriori algorithm 
## Overview
In this project we got familiar with one of the most important algorithms in data science
field which is “Apriori Algorithm”, this algorithm is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in
1994 for finding frequent item sets in a dataset for Boolean association rule. Name of
the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties.
We apply an iterative approach or level-wise search where k-frequent item sets are
used to find k+1 item sets.
By applying this algorithm we are able to understand the different relation between the
data that we acquired from different approaches and that will help us get more close
look on how the data are handled and how can we increase the efficiency of the work
and provide more useful offers to the clients by understanding the way they think and
deal with the different offers and materials.
Learning and understanding all these data and the rules between them and the different
relations that contains tons of data we would be able to apply different approaches and
algorithms in different fields to increase efficiency in different fields and increase the
production process with tons of useful data and new methods of development.
In this project we managed to deal with the data set and analyze and calculate the
support, confidence, lift and the leverage which provides a lot of data and information
about our data set which will help us understand more how to work with them and
provide new method to deal with these data.
